Goal:
Design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the maximum possible height.

Given design constraints:
- 2D design space 150cm wide x 50cm tall
- 1 bar of fixed length
- 3 pin supports, two of which must be connected to the ground
- 1 linear actuator chosen from this <a href="https://www.tolomatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2700-4000_29_IMA_cat.pdf">catalog</a>
- Part 1: all components and supports are rigid

My chosen design:

Justification of design elements:
- Linear actuator: 
IMA55-RN05 has the highest peak thrust rating out of all the actuators in the catalog. The amount of thrust that can be generated by the actuator directly impacts the amount of weight that can be lifted. This actuator is also in the maximum stroke bracket of these actuators, 152.4mm - 457.2mm.
- Orientation of the actuator and bar: 
By placing the actuator and pivot point of the rigid bar as far away from each other as possible, the torque lever arm is maximized.
- Location of weight: 
Placing the weight closer to the actuator reduces the amount of weight that can be lifted, but increases the maximum height. Placing the weight closer to the bar pivot increases the amount of weight that can be lifted, but decreases the maximum height.

To strike a balance between maximum weight and maximum height, I chose to place the weight halfway in between the bar pivot and the actuator. Diagram of my final design:

Calculation of the maximum height of the bar, constrained by the maximum stroke of the linear actuator (45.72cm). Maximum height found to be 22.65cm.

Calculation of the maximum weight. The most thrust is required when the bar is almost flat in its starting position. The peak thrust of IMA55-RN05 is 35.81kN. Due to the small initial angle of the bar (5 degrees), it is approximated as horizontal. The weight of the bar itself was assumed to be negligible. The maximum weight is found to be 71.62kN or 7.31kg.

Part 2: the bar is no longer considered rigid. Find the lightest bar cross section design such that its vertical deflection is below 2% of its length.

Calculation for the vertical deflection of the beam. The maximum deflection should occur at the midspan of the beam because loading is applied at the midspan and is otherwise symmetric. Maximum deflection should occur when the bar is flat, because that is when the greatest thrust is applied by the actuator.

Calculation of I, using E = 200GPa for structural steel. Structural steel actually has a better ratio of density to modulus of elasticity than titanium, with (7860kg/m^3)/(200Gpa) = 39.3 for steel vs (4730kg/m^3)/(115Gpa) = 41.1 for titanium. Other materials, like Douglas fir, have an even better ratio, but have such a small E that it would take an unreasonably large cross section to support the load. Therefore, structural steel is the chosen beam material. The maximum allowable deflection is 3.016cm (0.02*150.8cm).

Calculation of I using the formula for a simply supported beam with an applied load at the midspan. Gives the same I as the hand calculated integration.

Comparison of different beam cross sections from textbook tables in the general range of I. Cross sectional area corresponds to weight. The beam with the smallest cross sectional area with an I > 0.854x10^6 mm^4 is C100x8.

Final beam cross section design. The total mass of the beam is 5.305kg. The weight would be placed on top of or hung below the cross section.
