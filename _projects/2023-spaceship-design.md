Goal:
Design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the maximum possible height.

Given design constraints:
- 2D design space 150cm wide x 50cm tall
- 1 bar of fixed length
- 3 pin supports, two of which must be connected to the ground
- 1 linear actuator chosen from this catalog: https://www.tolomatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2700-4000_29_IMA_cat.pdf
- All components and supports are rigid

My chosen design:

Justification of design elements:
- Linear actuator: 
IMA55-RN05 has the highest peak thrust rating out of all the actuators in the catalog. The amount of thrust that can be generated by the actuator directly impacts the amount of weight that can be lifted. This actuator is also in the maximum stroke bracket of these actuators, 152.4mm - 457.2mm.
- Orientation of the actuator and bar: 
By placing the actuator and pivot point of the rigid bar as far away from each other as possible, the torque lever arm is maximized.
- Location of weight: 
Placing the weight closer to the actuator reduces the amount of weight that can be lifted, but increases the maximum height. Placing the weight closer to the bar pivot increases the amount of weight that can be lifted, but decreases the maximum height.

To strike a balance between maximum weight and maximum height, I chose to place the weight halfway in between the bar pivot and the actuator.
